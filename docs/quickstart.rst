Quick start
===========

In this section the user can find several use cases in which we applied GPMAP-tools to visualize and understand the qualitative feataures of the geometry of fitness landscapes of different size and complexity inferred mostly from high throughput mutagenesis experiments assessing nearly complete combinatorial sets of short sequences
