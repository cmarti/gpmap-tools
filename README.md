# gpmap-tools: tools for inference and visualization of complex genotype-phenotype maps

gpmap-tools is a python library containing a suite of tools for inference and visualization of
large and complex genotype-phenotype maps for genotypic spaces containing 
up to several million genotypes. 

gpmap-tools uses Gaussian process models to infer complete genotype-phenotype maps in the presence
of genetic interactions of every possible order from high throughput experimental data and observations of
natural sequences. gpmap-tools enables the statistical analysis of features
of these complex objects by handling the high dimensional posterior distribution over
the set of genotype-phenotype maps. 

gpmap-tools provides an open-source and easy to use interface of a slightly
modified version of the original method. Briefly, genotypes are embedded into a 
low dimensional coordinate system where the square distances are proportional to the required time
to evolve from one genotype to another under a Weak Mutation evolutionary model. This technique highlights
regions of sequence space that are highly inaccessible to each other and display the main qualitative
features of genotype-phenotype maps. 

gpmap-tools is written for Python 3 and is provided under an MIT open source license.
The documentation provided [here](https://gpmap-tools.readthedocs.io) is meant guide users through the basic principles underlying 
the method as well as explain how to use it for calculating the embedding coordinates and use
the functionalities provided for advanced plotting of their own fitness landscapes.

## Installation

### Create a new environment and activate it

The library has only been tested with specific versions of the dependent libraries, so we recommend the same to be used to avoid potential incompatibilities.

```
conda create -n gpmap python=3.8
conda activate gpmap
```

### Users: install from PyPI

```
pip install gpmap-tools
```

### Developers: from from repository

Download the repository using git and cd into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmarti/gpmap-tools.git
cd gpmap_tools
pip install .
```

Run tests using pytest

```bash
pytest test
```
