- Implement more memory and computationally efficient method for SeqDEFT computations: define a class 
for the Laplacian that uses the adjacency matrix with binary values to run calculations
- Avoid storing rate matrices in the visualization
- Remove dependency on specific alleles for building up SeqDEFT sequence space
as long as n_alleles is the same across sites. Use the guessed alphabet to do so
- Implement new likelihood functions for DeltaP based priors: poisson and binomial at least, maybe something
similar to GLM for regression like approaches: have likelihood function classes with log-likelihood and gradient methods
- Try to implement nodes_vmin option for plotly interactive plotting to keep color scale constant
even if we select top genotypes
- Create new classes of Discrete spaces for the extra models to  generate visualizations from: smily face and  tree-like
- Make datashader optional, maybe by moving datashader plotting to another plotting module
- review bounds for plots in datashader allele grid: padding option may not have been activated. Maybe build some default function to use across all datashader plots
- Write a method to plot a phylogenetic tree on a landscape: test on the codon landscape
- Write a method to simulate evolution in the landscape: use the jump matrix and exponential waiting times. 
- Write a method to simulate sequence evolution on a phylogenetic tree using the previous function.
- Review yiyun's emails about the data spliting problems: the P first components are maximum entropy so they may hve problems. It still only appears in the new version. Review what happens in teh very low data regime. What is the associated likelihood to the alleles that only appear in the test data and therefore are impossible under the model. 
- Review SeqDEFT to ensure that it is working properly and add some tests for it. Yiyun had some problems with a MAP curve
- Update SeqDEFT documentation with data simulated from DeltaP prior and a true data example. Make sure the colorscales in the simulated maps are the same. 
- Keep translated sequences in nodes df when using codon landscapes
- Go back and review polynomial coefficients calculations precision with different methods. We lose precision with l=7 or 8 already with current implementation
- Write docstrings for space variance components and vjs calculations and add to API reference
- Figure out inconsistency between using the correct eigenvalues and getting wrong projections in the skewed kernel. So far it makes more sense to have the correct projection operators
- Clean up some options for plotting that we are not using that much and make everything confusing.
- Fix error in calculation of rate matrix when having variable mutation rates
- Have default figure configurations in some global variables or configuration that can be easily changed across all plots
