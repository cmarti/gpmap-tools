High priority
- Remove dependency on specific alleles for building up SeqDEFT sequence space
  as long as n_alleles is the same across sites. Use the guessed alphabet to do so
- Try to implement nodes_vmin option for plotly interactive plotting to keep color scale constant
  even if we select top genotypes  
- Make datashader optional, maybe by moving datashader plotting to another plotting module
- Review bounds for plots in datashader allele grid: padding option may not have
  been activated. Maybe build some default function to use across all datashader plots
- Write docstrings for space variance components and vjs calculations and add to API reference
- Clean up some options for plotting that we are not using that much and make everything confusing.
- Add colorbar functionality for datashader plots
- Add function to center the spines in the visualizations
- Have default figure configurations in some global variables or configuration that can be easily changed across all plots
- Add function to plot path using nodes_df and a list of sequences
- Add method to sequence space to calculate best path between two sequences
- Remove data folder from docs and use always the built-in datasets
- Remove ParD datasets from docs
- Add seqdeft tutorial for the 5'ss using wei-chias dataset
- Merge with master branch and release new stable version to pypi
- Clean warnings and prints from running tests
- Remove tests dependencies on data outside the datasets. Use simulations

Mid priority
- Reimplement datashader plotting functions using v0.12 native mpl interface
- There is a clear problem when calculating the rate matrix with mutational biases
  Review and test if there is still error in calculation of rate matrix when having variable mutation rates
  Re-test mutational biases
- Think whether to implement an embedding object
- Streamline reduced alphabet
- Compare inv_dot using minres and taking the reciprocal of the eigenvalues.
  minres allows having different residual variances per observation though
- Implement the 1SD rule to select hyperparameter in cv
- Better figure out how to calculate the covariance distance using L polynomial
  and reimplement without L_powers_unique_entries_inv
  
Low priority
- Add some descriptions to the datasets and reference to the original paper
- Implement new likelihood functions for DeltaP based priors: poisson and binomial
  at least, maybe something similar to GLM for regression like approaches: have
  likelihood function classes with log-likelihood and gradient methods. 
  Another interesting possiblity is the use of contrastive losses
- Implement MEM model: either directly or using VCregression backbone. Fit a through Kernel alignment
  Have prior on kernel aligner for lambdas that forces it to have a DeltaP prior
- Create new classes of Discrete spaces for the extra models to  generate visualizations from: smily face and  tree-like
- Write a method to plot a phylogenetic tree on a landscape: test on the codon landscape
- Write a method to simulate evolution in the landscape: use the jump matrix and exponential waiting times. 
- Write a method to simulate sequence evolution on a phylogenetic tree using the previous function.
- Go back and review polynomial coefficients calculations precision with different methods.
  We lose precision with l=7 or 8 already with current implementation
- Figure out inconsistency between using the correct eigenvalues and getting wrong projections in the skewed kernel. So far it makes more sense to have the correct projection operators
- Optimize Laplacian matvec method for further efficiency if possible
- Figure out matrix free versions of Skewed Laplacian and Vj's projection operators

Long term
- Implement evidence maximization
- Implement contrastive losses
- Implement laplace approximation for variances in SeqDEFT
- Try MCMC on marginal likelihood
