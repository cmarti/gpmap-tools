- Remove dependency on specific alleles for building up SeqDEFT sequence space
as long as n_alleles is the same across sites. Use the guessed alphabet to do so
- Implement new likelihood functions for DeltaP based priors: poisson and binomial
  at least, maybe something similar to GLM for regression like approaches: have
  likelihood function classes with log-likelihood and gradient methods. 
  Another interesting possiblity is the use of contrastive losses
- Implement MEM model: either directly or using VCregression backbone. Fit a through Kernel alignment
- Try to implement nodes_vmin option for plotly interactive plotting to keep color scale constant
even if we select top genotypes
- Create new classes of Discrete spaces for the extra models to  generate visualizations from: smily face and  tree-like
- Make datashader optional, maybe by moving datashader plotting to another plotting module
- review bounds for plots in datashader allele grid: padding option may not have
  been activated. Maybe build some default function to use across all datashader plots
- Write a method to plot a phylogenetic tree on a landscape: test on the codon landscape
- Write a method to simulate evolution in the landscape: use the jump matrix and exponential waiting times. 
- Write a method to simulate sequence evolution on a phylogenetic tree using the previous function.
- Review SeqDEFT to ensure that it is working properly and add some tests for it. Yiyun had some problems with a MAP curve
- Update SeqDEFT documentation with data simulated from DeltaP prior and a true data example. Make sure the colorscales in the simulated maps are the same. 
- Go back and review polynomial coefficients calculations precision with different methods. We lose precision with l=7 or 8 already with current implementation
- Write docstrings for space variance components and vjs calculations and add to API reference
- Figure out inconsistency between using the correct eigenvalues and getting wrong projections in the skewed kernel. So far it makes more sense to have the correct projection operators
- Clean up some options for plotting that we are not using that much and make everything confusing.
- Add colorbar functionality for datashader plots
- Add function to center the spines in the visualizations
- Fix error in calculation of rate matrix when having variable mutation rates
- Have default figure configurations in some global variables or configuration that can be easily changed across all plots
- Reimplement datashader plotting functions using v0.12 native mpl interface
- Think whether to implement an embedding object
- Add docstrings to seqdeft and methods
- Streamline reduced alphabet
- Optimize Laplacian matvec method for further efficiency if possible
- Think about matrix free version of projection operators into the Vj's
- There is a clear problem when calculating the rate matrix with mutational biases
- Add function to plot path using nodes_df and a list of sequences
- Add method to sequence space to calculate best path between two sequences
- Remove data folder from docs and use always the built-in datasets
- Remove ParD datasets from docs
- Re-test mutational biases
- Release new stable version to pypi
- Update README from repository to refer to documentation directly
- Add seqdeft tutorial for the 5'ss using wei-chias dataset
