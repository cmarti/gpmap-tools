- Implement more memory and computationally efficient method for SeqDEFT computations: define a class 
for the Laplacian that uses the adjacency matrix with binary values to run calculations
- Avoid storing rate matrices in the visualization
- Remove dependency on specific alleles for building up SeqDEFT sequence space
as long as n_alleles is the same across sites. Use the guessed alphabet to do so
- Implement new likelihood functions for DeltaP based priors: poisson and binomial at least, maybe something
similar to GLM for regression like approaches: have likelihood function classes with log-likelihood and gradient methods
- Try to implement nodes_vmin option for plotly interactive plotting to keep color scale constant
even if we select top genotypes
- Reorder the documentation to have the theory with the simple grid examples
- Create new classes of Discrete spaces for the extra models to  generate visualizations from: smily face and  tree-like
- Make datashader optional, maybe by moving datashader plotting to another plotting module
