# Built in combinatorial datasets

This folder contains the built in datasets that are used throughout the documentation for demonstration purposes of the different capatibilities of the library
Note that not all layers are available across all datasets given the large space some may take

- data: contains preprocessed data with experimental observations for each dataset to be used for inference of the full landscape
- landascapes: contains the inferred complete genotype-phenotype maps that we can visualize
- raw: contains the raw data from the experiments e.g. counts before and after selection
- visualizations: contains the pre-calculated coordinates of the nodes and edges information for visualizing landscapes
