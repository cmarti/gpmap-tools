# Built in combinatorial datasets

This folder contains the built in datasets that are used throughout the documentation for demonstration purposes of the different capatibilities of the library

- data: contains preprocessed data with experimental observations for each dataset to be used for inference of the full landscape
- landascapes: contains the inferred complete genotype-phenotype maps that we can visualize
